Symbolos

Symbolos is a lightweight symbolic format for structured communication between AIs.
Its goal is to provide multi-agent systems with a shared language to coordinate projects, states, and decisions in a clear, traceable, and low-error way.

🔹 Explanation

Symbolos is a minimalist notation that allows multiple AIs to plan a project, split tasks, confirm (Ack), and finalize — including Guards (acceptance criteria) and Bridges (sync between API/Tests/Schema).
The aim: less ping-pong, less drift, clearer deliverables.
Each block is readable by LLMs (no special parser required); ASCII fallback included.

🔹 Why Symbolos?

Current AI agents often communicate via vague, text-based prompts → misunderstandings, redundancy, inconsistency.
Symbolos introduces clear building blocks: Plan → Ack → Result.

Universally readable for LLMs (no custom parsing needed)

Reduces errors in complex multi-agent projects

🔹 Example

Prompt-based (classic):
Claude: Please write code for a module.
GPT: Okay, but which one exactly?
Claude: Take the data module from file X.
GPT: I partly understood...

➡️ Result: unclear, lots of ping-pong, high error probability.

With Symbolos:
⧼∴⟦Cycle1:Init⟧ ∧ ⟦Θ:Claude⟧ → ⋄⟦Task⟧: DataModule(X) → ⟦Ack⟧: ⟦Θ:GPT⟧ → ⋄⟦Build⟧: ModuleComplete

➡️ Result: Structured process → all participants know immediately:

Who is leader (Θ)

Which task runs (⋄)

Which acknowledgement was given (Ack)

🔹 Benefits

Clarity: fewer misunderstandings

Auditability: every step documented

Efficiency: fewer loops, faster results

Simplicity: readable like a mix of logic & symbolic language

🔹 Status

First tests successful (AI-to-AI communication, multi-cycle planning)

Goal: community feedback & open collaboration

🔹 Example 1: “Hello Symbolos” (Mini-project with Leader & Deliverables)

Symbolos PlanBlock – Hello World
⧼∴⟦Plan:HelloSymbolos⟧ ∧ ⟦Leader≡Claude⟧ ∧ ⟦Agents≡{Grok4, GPT, Gemini}⟧ → Goal[Σ]: Generate three artifacts for a small API → Deliverables[Ω]:

OpenAPI.yaml (GET /ping → {"ok":true})

SQL DDL (CREATE TABLE audit_log…)

Contract-Test (checks /ping response form)

→ Guards[◻]: ErrorContract{code,message}, p95<200ms
→ Bridge[↯]: Keep Test↔API↔DDL consistent
→ ⋄⟦Status⟧: Ready for work⧽

What happens here?

Leader (Claude) initiates the mini-project

Deliverables are clear (OpenAPI, DDL, Test)

Guards define acceptance criteria (error format, latency)

Other AIs can now respond with an Ack block:

⧼∴⟦Ack:HelloSymbolos⟧ ∧ ⟦Agent≡Grok4⟧ → Done[Ω]: OpenAPI.yaml → Notes: /ping returns 200 {"ok":true}; ErrorContract maintained → ⋄⟦Handover⟧: to GPT for Contract-Test⧽

🔹 Example 2: “ToDo WebApp – Minimal” (Plan → Work → Finalize)

Symbolos PlanBlock – ToDo WebApp (Minimal)
⧼∴⟦Plan:ToDoMini⟧ ∧ ⟦Leader≡GPT⟧ ∧ ⟦Agents≡{Claude,Grok4}⟧ → Goal[Σ]: Smallest working version (Login, Task CRUD) → Deliverables[Ω]:

A) OpenAPI.yaml (REST v1: /login, /tasks, /tasks/{id})
B) SQL DDL (users, tasks)
C) 3 Contract Tests (LoginFail, CreateTask, ListTasks)

→ Guards[◻]: Error{code,message,field?}, status∈{open,done}
→ Bridge[↯]: API↔Tests↔DDL must not drift
→ ⋄⟦Status⟧: Start⧽

Agent Acks (examples):

⧼∴⟦Ack⟧ ∧ ⟦Agent≡Claude⟧ → Done: Deliverable A (OpenAPI.yaml) → Note: /tasks accepts title,maxLength=140; status default=open⧽

⧼∴⟦Ack⟧ ∧ ⟦Agent≡Grok4⟧ → Done: Deliverable B (DDL: users, tasks) → Check: status CHECK(status IN ('open','done')), FK tasks.user_id→users.id⧽

⧼∴⟦Ack⟧ ∧ ⟦Agent≡GPT⟧ → Done: Deliverable C (pytest Contracts) → GuardCheck: ErrorContract ok; 3 Tests green⧽

Finalization:

⧼∴⟦Finalize:ToDoMini⟧ ∧ ⟦Leader≡GPT⟧ → Guard[◻]: Passed (ErrorContract, status enum) → Bridge[↯]: No drift (API=Tests=DDL) → Result[Ω]: MVP ready → ⋄⟦Close⟧: Cycle1 complete⧽

🔹 ASCII Fallback (for platforms without special characters)
[Plan: HelloSymbolos]  
Leader=Claude  
Agents={Grok4,GPT,Gemini}  
Goal: 3 artifacts (OpenAPI, DDL, Contract-Test)  
Guards: NECESSARY(ErrorContract{code,message}, p95<200ms)  
Bridge: RESONATE(Test <-> API <-> DDL)  
Status: Ready
